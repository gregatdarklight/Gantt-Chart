## Details
+ I have thought it would be a good idea to make a pessimist estimation, this is, probably I will begin working before February the 10th and probably I will be able to work beyond June the 1st.
+ I have not included writing the experiment results to a paper to aim for a publication because I believe that can be worked on during summer without schedule pressure.
+ I have accounted for weekends.
+ I would like to use this just as a guideline to be able to check that the project is in time, since it is likely that some dates change (for example, it is highly likely that the dates that I have specified for baseline and treatment measurement do not correspond to exact beginning and endings of sprints).
